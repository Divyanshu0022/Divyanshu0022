I'm Divyanshu, a 19-year-old Computer Science Engineering student at Sandip University. With a strong foundation in C/C++, Python, HTML, and CSS, I'm passionate about the future of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its potential to revolutionize our world.

## My Goals:
- Contribute to the development of AI, ensuring its safety and leveraging its benefits for the advancement of humankind.

- Continuously learn about technology management.

## Why I Believe in Managing Technology:
While many people are creating and using technology, it's equally important to manage its potential drawbacks. Let's build a better future together! ðŸŒŸ
